# Building Low Latency Trading Systems

This repository contains code and experiments inspired by "Building Low Latency Applications with C++" by Sourav Ghosh. The goal is to understand and innovate the complexities of a trading system, focusing on high-performance and low-latency C++ code.

## Overview

This project aims to implement a basic Market Publisher - Market Client trading platform. It will evolve into a more complex system, adhering to strict coding guidelines and leveraging historical computing knowledge for modern problems. The code here is written with an emphasis on:

- Data-oriented design
- Parallel computation
- Critical path optimization
- Low-latency networking
- NUMA architectures
- Cache optimization
- Exchange protocols
- High-frequency trading concepts

## Guidelines

This project follows MISRA guidelines to ensure robust and maintainable code. Additionally, new C++ features or standards will be incorporated if they benefit the implementation. These features will be extensively documented to provide clarity and understanding.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
